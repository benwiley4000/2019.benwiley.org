## ben wiley's new website

This is a website where I talk about myself a lot.

I built it with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), which is cool and fast
but kind of overengineered. You should try it if you need to embed React
components in a static site, though!

The site features an embedded music player powered by
[Cassette](https://github.com/benwiley4000/cassette), an open source media
player UI library for React. I've developed Cassette with the help of some kind
users/contributors.

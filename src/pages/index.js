    <p>
      When I'm not working on open source software, making music or developing indie video
      games, I'm probably at my day job at Element AI. There I help build a platform that
      helps artificial intelligence researchers run experiments and build products around
      cutting-edge machine learning techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes I give presentations on topics related to programming at meetups
      and conferences. In the past I've also led workshops on jazz improvisation
      and student organizing. I'm a native English speaker, and these days, my
      French isn't too bad either.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2015 I received a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Sociology and a Minor in
      Computer Science from Davidson College in Davidson, North Carolina, USA.
